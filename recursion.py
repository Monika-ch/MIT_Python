"""
    For Example:
        
    Letâ€™s say we call gcdRecur(9, 12). The function will check if b (12) is zero,
    and since it is not, it will return gcdRecur(12, 9 % 12). The % operator gives 
    the remainder of a division, so 9 % 12 is 9. 
    
    Now the function will run again with a = 12 and b = 9. It will check if 
    b (9) is zero, and since it is not, it will return gcdRecur(9, 12 % 9). 
    The remainder of 12 % 9 is 3. Now the function will run again with a = 9 and
    b = 3. It will check if b (3) is zero, and since it is not, it will return 
    gcdRecur(3, 9 % 3). The remainder of 9 % 3 is 0. 
    
    Now the function will run again with a = 3 and b = 0. It will check if b
    (0) is zero, and since it is, it will return a (3) as the answer. 
    This is the base case where the recursion stops.
    
    So, by using return gcdRecur(b, a % b), we are making the function call 
    itself repeatedly with smaller values of a and b, until we find the gcd.
